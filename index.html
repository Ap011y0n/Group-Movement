<h3> Group Movement in RTS </h3>
Intro to the problem
In RTS games we’ll be moving a bunch of units across the map. This differs from any other genre, every unit will need to react to every other unit, in order to move coherently and at the same time follow the players orders. When using a pathfinding algorithm for your troops, like A*, you’ll notice that they will start overlapping against eachother. This problem can be treated in different ways, here we’ll talk about some of this methods, what methods did popular games used and apply one of them to our own game engine, so we can start developing a proper RTS videogame


Approaches: 

Flow-based Approach It focus on the crowd as a whole rather than its components. As such individuals do not have any distinctive behaviors, and won’t be affected by any input from their surroundings or their behaviour.

Entity-based Approach Entities do not have the capacity to think for themselves. All movements are determined by the global laws being enforced on them. 

Agent-based 
Each agent of a crowd is given a degree of intelligence; they can react to each situation on their own based on a set of decision rules. Information used to decide on an action is obtained locally from the agent's’ surroundings.
